== Bugfix: Update PSU Data (Select Authentication Method) for account information consent request fails with an error

Executing valid Update PSU Data (Select Authentication Method) for account information consent request
 (`PUT /v1/consents/{consentId}/authorisations/{authorisationId}`) with non-json body will no longer result in
 `400 FORMAT_ERROR` being returned in the response.

== Bugfix: Increase the length of the `iban` and `end_to_end_identification` columns in the database

Types of the `iban` and `end_to_end_identification` columns were changed to increase the value length limit.
The type of the `iban` column in the `account_reference` table was changed to `VARCHAR(34)` and the type of the
`end_to_end_identification` column in the `pis_payment_data` table was changed to the `VARCHAR(35)`.

== Bugfix: Enriched AccountReference validation

From now on, while creating the consent or payment, every account reference must have only one attribute (IBAN, BBAN,
PAN etc). If there are several attributes in the initial JSON body - the `400 FORMAT ERROR` is returned. The list of
bank supportable attributes is located in the bank_profile ASPSP configuration file (`supportedAccountReferenceFields`
parameter). Also, possible errors while creating bank offered AIS consent are fixed.

== IBAN is no longer added to the supported account reference fields by default

IBAN is no longer added to the `supportedAccountReferenceFields` property of the ASPSP profile in source code by default.
It should be added to the bank_profile explicitly.

== Bugfix: Remove printing sensitive data in logs

From now on, sensitive data like internal ASPSP Account ID, balances and transactions isn't printed in logs.
