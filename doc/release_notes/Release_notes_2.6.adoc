== Bugfix: Incorrect property name in the response to the AIS consent creation request

From now on,  the endpoint for consent creation (POST `/v1/consents`) returns correct response with field `psuMessage` instead of `message`.

== Counting frequencyPerDay only for one-off consent or for recurring consent without PSU IP address
From now on, we don't count the number of consent usages for recurring consent with PSU IP address (`PSU-IP-Address` header) for every endpoint.
